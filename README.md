# ALL-IN-ONE : Artificial-Association-Networks
ALL-IN-ONE

This AAN is a neural network model for processing $\exists x$ and $\forall$ simultaneously.
Processing many x's is different from processing any x's.
When we accept information in the real world, we receive other information along with that information. 
The information that all brain-bearing creatures receive comes from various sensory organs at the same time.
And the information is so complicated that I don't think humans should fix that structure.
Therefore, it is Artificial Association Networks that express the layer-centered model of neural networks as neurotree data and learn as a single cell.
That's the ALL-IN-ONE model.
Once the paper is published, i will post the full code along with the tutorial code.
