#shell sort is a variation of insertion sort
#slicing method [a::b] is the key
#we gotta cut the original list into a few small groups

#assume we have a list of n elements
#the first step, we do b=n//a, we get a few sublists by [a::b]
#we apply insertion sort on those sublists and concatenate
#next, we do b=b//a, and we obtain a few new sublists by [a::b]
#we apply insertion sort on new sublists and concatenate
#we keep using //a method and do insertion sort and concatenate
#til b reaches zero
#we concatenate sublists and do a final insertion sort
#we shall end up with a sorted list
#the time complexity is quite difficult to calculate

    #the first step is to initialize a
    #we will use this variable to divide the list and do slicing
